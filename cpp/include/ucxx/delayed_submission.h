   * @brief Constructor for a delayed submission operation.
   *
   * Construct a delayed submission operation. Delayed submission means that a transfer
   * operation will not be submitted immediately, but will rather be delayed for the next
   * progress iteration.
   *
   * This may be useful to avoid any transfer operations to be executed directly in the
   * application thread, delaying all of them for the worker progress thread when enabled.
   * With this approach any perceived overhead will be removed from the application thread,
   * and thus provide some speedup in certain situations. It may be also useful to prevent
   * a multi-threaded application for blocking while waiting for the UCX spinlock, since
   * all transfer operations may be pushed to the worker progress thread.
   *
   * @param[in] send        whether this is a send (`true`) or receive (`false`) operation.
   * @param[in] buffer      a raw pointer to the data being transferred.
   * @param[in] length      the size in bytes of the message being transfer.
   * @param[in] tag         tag to match for this operation (only applies for tag
   *                        operations).
   * @param[in] memoryType  the memory type of the buffer.
