   * - `ucxx::Endpoint::flushBuilder()`
   * - `ucxx::Worker::flushBuilder()`
   * - `ucxx::requestFlushBuilder()`

   *                      `std::shared_ptr<ucxx::Worker>`.

   *                                `std::shared_ptr<Worker>`.
   * @param[in] requestData         container of the specified message type, including all
   *                                type-specific data.
   * @param[in] operationName       a human-readable operation name to help identifying
   *                                requests by their types when UCXX logging is enabled.
   * @param[in] enablePythonFuture  whether a python future should be created and
   *                                subsequently notified.
   * @param[in] callbackFunction    user-defined callback function to call upon completion.
   * @param[in] callbackData        user-defined data to pass to the `callbackFunction`.
