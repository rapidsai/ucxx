 * `ucxx::PythonFutureTask` since the exact time the destructor is called may be
 * unpredictable w.r.t. the Python application, and thus requiring the GIL may result in
 * deadlocks if it can't be done at appropriate stages. The application is thus responsible
 * to ensure `PythonFutureTaskCollector::push()` is regularly called and ultimately
 * responsible for cleaning up before terminating, otherwise a resource leakage may occur.
