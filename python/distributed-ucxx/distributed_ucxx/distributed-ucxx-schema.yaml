      cuda-copy:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Set environment variables to enable CUDA support over UCX. This may be used even if
          InfiniBand and NVLink are not supported or disabled, then transferring data over TCP.
      tcp:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Set environment variables to enable TCP over UCX, even if InfiniBand and NVLink
          are not supported or disabled.
      nvlink:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Set environment variables to enable UCX over NVLink, implies ``distributed-ucxx.tcp=True``.
      infiniband:
        type: [boolean, 'null']

          Set environment variables to enable UCX over InfiniBand, implies ``distributed-ucxx.tcp=True``.
      rdmacm:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Set environment variables to enable UCX RDMA connection manager support,
          requires ``distributed-ucxx.infiniband=True``.
      create-cuda-context:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Creates a CUDA context before UCX is initialized. This is necessary to enable UCX to
          properly identify connectivity of GPUs with specialized networking hardware, such as
          InfiniBand. This permits UCX to choose transports automatically, without specifying
          additional variables for each transport, while ensuring optimal connectivity. When
          ``True``, a CUDA context will be created on the first device listed in
          ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``.
      multi-buffer:
        type: [boolean, 'null']
        description: |
          Enable multi-buffer send/recv interface for improved performance with multiple small messages.
          When enabled, multiple frames can be sent/received in a single operation.
      environment:
        type: object
        description: |
          Mapping for setting arbitrary UCX environment variables.
          Names here are translated via the following rules to
          map to the relevant UCX environment variable:
            - hyphens are replaced with underscores
            - words are uppercased
            - UCX_ is prepended
          So, for example, setting ``some-option=value`` is
          equivalent to setting ``UCX_SOME_OPTION=value`` in
          the calling environment.

          For a full list of supported UCX environment
          variables, run ``ucx_info -f``.

          pool-size:
            type: [string, integer, 'null']
            description: |
              The size of the memory pool in bytes or as a string with units (e.g., "1GB", "500MB").
              When specified, RMM will be initialized with a memory pool of this size for improved
              GPU memory allocation performance.
