    """Run function in a subprocess, forwarding exceptions to an error queue.

    Use this as the ``target`` for ``multiprocessing.Process``, passing the
    same ``error_queue`` to :func:`terminate_process`.  Any unhandled exception
    raised by ``target`` will be serialized as a formatted traceback string and
    placed in ``error_queue`` before being re-raised, so the process still
    exits with a non-zero code.  :func:`terminate_process` then reads from
    that queue and raises a :class:`RuntimeError` that includes the full
    subprocess traceback rather than the generic "Process did not exit cleanly"
    message.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : callable
        The function to run in the subprocess.
    error_queue : multiprocessing.Queue
        Queue that receives the formatted traceback string on failure.
    *args
        Positional arguments forwarded to ``target``.
    **kwargs
        Keyword arguments forwarded to ``target``.

    Join a list of processes with a combined timeout, for each process `join()`
    is called with a timeout equal to the difference of `timeout` and the time
    elapsed since this function was called.

    Parameters
    ----------
    processes:
        The list of processes to be joined.
    timeout: float or integer
        Maximum time to wait for all the processes to be joined.

    Ensure a spawned process is terminated.

    Ensure a spawned process is really terminated to prevent the parent process
    (such as pytest) from freezing upon exit.

    Parameters
    ----------
    process:
        The process to be terminated.
    kill_wait: float or integer
        Maximum time to wait for the kill signal to terminate the process.
    error_queue: multiprocessing.Queue, optional
        When the subprocess was started via :func:`run_in_subprocess`, pass
        the same queue here.  If the process exited with a non-zero code,
        ``terminate_process`` will pull the formatted traceback from the queue
        and include it in the raised :class:`RuntimeError`, making the root
        cause visible without digging into subprocess logs.

    Raises
    ------
    RuntimeError
        If the process terminated with a non-zero exit code.
    ValueError
        If the process was still alive after ``kill_wait`` seconds.
